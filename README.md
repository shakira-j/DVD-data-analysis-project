# DVD-data-analysis-project
The purpose of this project was to create business reports that will answer a business question for a fictional DVD company. 
The business question I decided to answer is "What are the top 3 film categories with the most revenue?"
In this project I will be transforming data so that it can be used for analysis and to provide a direct answer to the business question. The SQL code shows creation of queries and the creation of SQL functions, triggers, and stored procedures to streamline analysis.
There are two distinct sections that differ in the granularity of the data they present and how directly they support the answering of the business question. The detailed table will contain all data that informs the answer to the question at a very granular level, and the summary table will contain aggregated data that provide a direct answer to the business question.

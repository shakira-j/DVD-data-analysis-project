# DVD-data-analysis-project
The purpose of this project is to create business reports that will answer a business question for a fictional DVD company. 
The business question I decided to answer is "What are the top 3 film categories with the most revenue?".
In this project I will be transforming data so that it can be used for analysis. The SQL code will demonstrate abiilty to join multiple tables, and the ability to streamline analysis using SQL functions, triggers, and stored procedures.
There are two distinct sections that differ in the granularity of the data they present and how directly they support the answering of the business question. The detailed table will contain all data that informs the answer to the question at a very granular level, and the summary table will contain aggregated data that provide a direct answer to the business question.
